# Multi-Agent Roomba Cleaning Simulation Report

## 1. Problem Statement and Solution Proposal

### Problem
- Efficient cleaning of spaces using autonomous robotic agents (Roombas)
- Challenges include:
  - Limited battery life
  - Unknown environment navigation
  - Obstacle avoidance
  - Finding optimal cleaning paths
  - Coordination between multiple agents

### Solution Proposal
- Implementation of an intelligent multi-agent system where each Roomba:
  - Explores and maps its environment
  - Maintains battery levels
  - Cleans dirty areas efficiently
  - Returns to charging stations when needed
  - Coordinates with other agents (in multi-agent scenarios)

## 2. Agent Design

### Objectives
- Primary: Clean all dirty cells in the environment
- Secondary: Maintain sufficient battery level
- Tertiary: Explore unknown areas

### Effector Capabilities
- Movement: Up, Down, Left, Right
- Cleaning: Clean dirty cells
- Charging: Recharge at charging stations

### Perception
- Knowledge Matrix (3x3 grid around agent)
- States perceived:
  - Clean cells
  - Dirty cells
  - Obstacles
  - Charging stations
  - Unknown areas

### Proactivity
- Autonomous decision making based on:
  - Battery level
  - Known dirty cells
  - Unexplored areas
  - Distance to charging station

### Performance Metrics
1. Cleaning Efficiency
   - Percentage of clean cells
   - Number of movements per clean cell
2. Battery Management
   - Average battery level
   - Charging frequency
3. Exploration
   - Percentage of explored cells
   - Time to full exploration

## 3. Subsumption Architecture

### Layer 1: Battery Management (Highest Priority)
